## Discord Custom Profile Picture
---
in your theme or custom css, add this: ```@import url('https://cyleja1234.github.io/DCP/usrpfp.css');```
then everyone who has a custom pfp will show to have a gif; if you want your own go to issues and copy, paste, and fillout this:
```
still photo (URL)
animated photo (URL)
I have read and under stand Discord's TOS []
```
the stilll phto will be the original photo that you see withought you hovering over their profile, the animated photo is shown once you hover over their profile, then you agree that I am not affeliated with anything that happends (add `x` in the box).
